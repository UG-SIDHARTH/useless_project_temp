### Project Description
An absurdly over-engineered 3D anime browser game called **"Spider-Man Snakes & Ladders"** that has **strictly ZERO snakes and ZERO ladders**. Built for an 18-hour hackathon, 2 to 4 human players pass-and-play locally on a single device as identical Mary Janes (distinguished strictly by hair color: Auburn Red, Electric Cyan, Golden Blonde, and Toxic Emerald) navigating a 100-tile rooftop board guarded by 6 Spider-Men with mechanical gold legs, 3 hoverboard-flying Green Goblins, and 3 dark-singularity black-hole portals—with an insane climax where the **1st player to reach Tile 100 is ambushed and captured by Doctor Octopus**, springing the trap so the **2nd player to reach Tile 100 wins the game!**

---

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Traditional board games like *Snakes & Ladders* have suffered for centuries from a severe, unacceptable lack of web-slinging superheroes, pumpkin bombs, dark gravitational wormholes, and tentacled supervillains ambushing players at the finish line. Millions of friendships are ruined by boring 2D flat cardboard dice rolls when what the world truly needed was an over-the-top 3D Marvel anime thriller on a Manhattan skyscraper where winning requires sacrificing your best friend to Doctor Octopus so you can snatch the victory trophy right behind them.

---

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a completely physical 3D anime universe in the browser! Players choose between **2-Player, 3-Player, or 4-Player** pass-and-play modes on a single device, controlling identical Mary Janes differing strictly by vibrant hair colors (Auburn Red, Electric Cyan, Golden Blonde, Toxic Emerald). 
- Instead of climbing ladders, **6 Spider-Men** visibly fire web lines across the 3D board to yank you forward through mid-air.
- Instead of sliding down snakes, **3 Green Goblins** tackle you onto their jet hoverboards and kidnap you downward.
- **3 Portal Pairs (6 black-hole singularities)** warp you upward into the cosmos.
- **The Tile 100 Dual Climax**:
  - When the **1st Player** reaches Tile 100 with an exact roll: **Doctor Octopus** erupts from above, grabs them in mechanical titanium claws, and repeatedly leaps across the skyline into the fog—eliminating them!
  - Tile 100 springs open and converts on the physical board into the golden **🏆 WIN TILE 100**.
  - The **2nd Player** (or next active player) to roll the exact count to Tile 100 escapes the ambush and **WINS THE GAME!**
